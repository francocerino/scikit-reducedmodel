Tutorials
=========

The following page contains a collection of tutorials, practical examples and
problems solved with Scikit-ReducedModels.

The **Simple Pendulum** tutorial contains a simple example of how to use skreducedmodel 
to build a reduced model of a simple pendulum. This example shows the basic 
functionality of skreducedmodel which is to build reduced models with and without domain partitioning. 

The **Gravitational Wave Science** tutorial contains more complex examples showing the 
full functionality of skreducedmodel using a set of gravitational waves.
