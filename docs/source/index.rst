`Scikit-ReduceModel <https://github.com/francocerino/scikit-reducedmodel>`_ is a Python package to construct reduced basis.
This code is an extension of the standard reduced-base framework and provides an efficient 
and accurate solution for model building. It implements the `hp-greedy refinement <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08554>`_ strategy, an enhancement 
approach for reduced-base model building. The approach uses a parameter space partitioning, a local 
reduced basis and a binary tree as the resulting structure, all obtained automatically.
